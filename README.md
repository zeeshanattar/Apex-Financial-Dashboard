# 5.3) Walk Through The Key Visuals
The Total Cost KPI is a core finance control metric. Its purpose goes beyond just showing expenses — it helps stakeholders understand efficiency, profitability, and cost discipline.

The Total Profit KPI is one of the most important executive finance metrics. Its purpose is to show whether the business is actually creating value, not just generating sales.

The Total Revenue KPI represents the top-line performance of a business. Its purpose is to show how much money the company is generating from sales activities, before any costs are deducted.

The Total Quantity KPI measures the physical volume of units sold. Its purpose is to show how much the business sells in terms of units, not money — which gives insights that revenue alone cannot.

A Profit by Category pie chart shows how total profit is distributed across categories, helping executives understand profit concentration and portfolio balance.

The Profit by Region – Donut Chart is used to show how total profit is distributed across geographic regions, helping decision-makers understand where the business is actually earning money.

The Monthly Sales per Year line chart is a classic time-series analysis visual that tracks how sales (or revenue) change month by month for each year. Its purpose is to uncover trends, seasonality, and performance patterns over time.

The Monthly Profit and Revenue Clustered Column Chart is a side-by-side comparison visual that shows both revenue and profit for each month. Its purpose is to help users see the relationship between revenue and profit, identify patterns, and detect gaps in profitability.

The Region Slicer is a filtering control in a dashboard that lets users dynamically view data for specific regions. Its purpose is to make the dashboard interactive, focused, and relevant to the viewer’s needs.

The Top Profitable Sub-Category Clustered Bar Chart is a key visual for profitability analysis. Its purpose is to show which sub-categories contribute the most profit, making it easy to prioritize business decisions and resource allocation.

A Cost by Category stacked column chart shows how total costs are distributed across categories and sub-components, enabling management to identify cost drivers and optimize profitability.

A Geo Distribution Map shows how key business metrics are distributed geographically, helping executives identify high-performing regions, market opportunities, and regional risks.

The Revenue by Product Clustered Bar Chart is a visual that shows how much revenue each product generates, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify top-selling products and revenue distribution across the product portfolio.

A Salesperson Treemap visualizes each salesperson’s contribution proportionally, helping managers quickly identify top performers, low performers, and allocate resources effectively.

# 5.4) Bussiness Impact And Insight
The dashboard highlights that revenue is growing, but rising costs are limiting profit growth, indicating a need for cost optimization. Profit and revenue are concentrated in a few categories, products, and regions, suggesting both dependency risks and opportunities for diversification. Regional and sales team insights reveal areas for expansion and performance improvement, enabling data-driven strategic decisions.
